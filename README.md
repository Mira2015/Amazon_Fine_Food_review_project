<Br/>**How often do you shop on Amazon ? Do you think review is important to you ?**

**Have you ever hesitated to buy something if you see a negative review ?** 

**After you read some positive reviews, you decide to buy the product and then notice the reviews are categorized as "not helpful," will this change your decision about purchasing the product?**


## Project Overview: 

**Background:** 
Recently more and more Amazon sellers realized how customers’ reviews can
impact other buyers’ decision making. Since most of customers will hesitate to
make a purchase decision if the product has a negative review. As an analyst,
my goal is to help the business to provide the good shopping experience. So, I
want to develop the model to predict if a review is helpful or not helpful from
sentiment analysis. Then the modeling outcome will help Amazon’s merchants have
better understand about customers’ attitudes towards reviews.

**Supervised modeling:** 
The purpose of this analysis is to build a prediction model where we will be able to predict whether a review is helpful or not helpful. This is the classifcation problem.<br>

## This Project consists of three parts:  <br>   

**Part 1: Data Wrangling**  [Code](https://github.com/Mira2015/Amazon_Fine_Food_review_project/blob/master/Amazon_DataWrangling_Final.ipynb)
 <br>1.1 Numerical data clean 
 <br>1.2 Text data preprocessing
 <br>1.3 Word cloud visualization 

**Part 2: Inferential Statistics** [Code](https://github.com/Mira2015/Amazon_Fine_Food_review_project/blob/master/Amazon_inferential%20statistics_Final.ipynb) <br>
2.1. Hypothesis test 

**Part 3: Modeling** [Code](https://github.com/Mira2015/Amazon_Fine_Food_review_project/blob/master/Amazon_Modeling_draft1.ipynb) <br>

#### Modeling processes<br>

<br>3.1. Model training 
<br>3.2. Model evaluation and validation 
<br>3.3. Final model tuning and optimization
<br>3.4. Conclusions

## Results: <br>
![alt text](https://github.com/Mira2015/Amazon_Fine_Food_review_project/blob/master/ROC.png)

We observe that the area under the curve(AUC) is equal to 0.89.  <br>
The result shows that our Logistic Regression model has better performance to distinguish helpful and not helpful reviews.
